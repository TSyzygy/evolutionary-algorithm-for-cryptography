- Transposition doesn't finish configuring when keylength < n
- When history given in setup, improvement is impossible unless knownScores are provided. See population-worker.js, line 42: knownScores[keyToString(candidates[i])] is undefined so score cannot be greater than it.
- Idea:
  - In standard-worker-module-functions.js, add a module that deals with different possible permutation steps; to automatically change over time and settle when the algorithm is working well
  - Potentially also link with simulated annealing / temperature
